<h1>jQuery Demo</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Separation of JavaScript and HTML: The jQuery library provides simple syntax for adding event handlers to the DOM using JavaScript, rather than adding HTML event attributes to call JavaScript functions. Thus, it encourages developers to completely separate JavaScript code from HTML markup.</li>
	<li>Brevity and clarity: jQuery promotes brevity and clarity with features like "chainable" functions and shorthand function names.</li>
	<li>Elimination of cross-browser incompatibilities: The JavaScript engines of different browsers differ slightly so JavaScript code that works for one browser may not work for another. Like other JavaScript toolkits, jQuery handles all these cross-browser inconsistencies and provides a consistent interface that works across different browsers.</li>
</ul>
